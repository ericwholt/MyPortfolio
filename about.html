                    I have spent my career learning what I need to know. My passion for technology started
                    early. In sixth grade I got a Tandy 64 for Christmas and started writing color basic out of a book
                    that came with it. I started combining various projects and creating things. I knew then I wanted
                    to be a programmer. Life happens, and other opportunities were available, and I jumped on it. I
                    spent 20 years of my professional career working in IT and customer support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finally took the leap and transitioned my career into software development.
                    I went to a programming boot camp for C# backend development. I graduated and I have been working in
                    software development since. I am happy with my choice and would not change it for the world.
